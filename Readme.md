======

This project is a test project to try the pybind11 library's functionalities implementing a Matrix class like numpy one.

The functions implements all the OOP functionalities in c++11 and then it exposes the functions to python.

There are two main files one for C++ and the other for python. The code compiles using CMake and it links to Python libraries using the provided CMake functionalities in a clean way.

This example contains inheritance, iterators, and interaction with our implementation and Numpy.
